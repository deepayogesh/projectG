Exploratory Data Analysis Steps
===============================

0. Download data from https://datasets.imdbws.com/
	- title.basics.tsv.gz (11/12/2021)
	- title.akas.tsv.gz (11/12/2021)
	- title.ratings.tsv.gz (11/11/2021)
   
   Dataset Details can be viewed at https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/

1. Unzip all three files to *.tsv

2. Rename title.basics.tsv to title_basics.tsv
   Since title_basics.tsv is 700 mb in its original form, filter entries on
   a Bash Terminal prior to loading into Python using the following
   command, which filters entries only to Non-Adult Movie Titles with No NULLS
   ('endYear' column is dropped in process):

perl -F"\t" -lne 'print $F[0]."\t".$F[1]."\t".$F[2]."\t".$F[3]."\t".$F[4]."\t".$F[5]."\t".$F[7]."\t".$F[8]' title_basics.tsv | perl -F"\t" -lne 'print if $.==1 || ($_!~/\\N/ && $F[1]=~/movie/ && $F[4]=~/0/ && $F[7]!~/Adult/)' > title_basics_non-adult_movies_no_nulls.tsv

3. Rename title.akas.tsv to title_akas.tsv
   Obtain US-only Title IDs from title_akas.tsv
   using the following command on a Bash Terminal:

   awk -F"\t" 'NR==1 || $4~/US/{print $1}' title_akas.tsv | sort | uniq > US_title_ids.csv

4. Rename title.ratings.tsv to title_ratings.tsv
   Convert title_ratings.tsv to CSV via the following
   command on a Bash Termainal:

   cat title_ratings.tsv | tr "\t" "," > title_ratings.csv

5. Perform subsequent exploratory data analysis and data cleaning using Python running within
Jupyter Notebook.

	- Remove Titles where primaryTitle is not the same as originalTitle in
	  order to filter out films which were US Releases of Foreign Films.
	- In order to guarantee title uniqueness for remakes, search for
	  duplicate primaryTitle and concatenate Film Release Year to the
	  primaryTitle.
	- Filter Titles for Title IDs that are only present in the
	  titles_us_ids_only list.
	- Include Titles only released in 1920 or later.
