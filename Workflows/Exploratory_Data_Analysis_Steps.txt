Exploratory Data Analysis Steps
===============================

0. Download data from https://datasets.imdbws.com/
	- title.basics.tsv.gz (11/12/2021)
	- title.akas.tsv.gz (11/12/2021)
	- title.ratings.tsv.gz (11/11/2021)
   
   Dataset Details can be viewed at https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/

1. Unzip all three files to *.tsv

2. Rename title.basics.tsv to title_basics.tsv
   Since title_basics.tsv is 700 mb in its original form, filter entries on
   a Bash Terminal prior to loading into Python using the following
   command, which filters entries only to Non-Adult Movie Titles:

   perl -F"\t" -lne 'print if $.==1 || ($F[1]=~/movie/ && $F[4]=~/0/ && $F[8]!~/Adult/)' title_basics.tsv > title_basics_non-adult_movies.tsv

3. Rename title.akas.tsv to title_akas.tsv
   Obtain US-only Title IDs from title_akas.tsv
   using the following command on a Bash Terminal:

   awk -F"\t" 'NR==1 || $4~/US/{print $1}' title_akas.tsv | sort | uniq > US_title_ids.csv

4. Rename title.ratings.tsv to title_ratings.tsv
   Convert title_ratings.tsv to CSV via the following
   command on a Bash Termainal:

   cat title_ratings.tsv | tr "\t" "," > title_ratings.csv

5. Perform subsequent exploratory data analysis using Python running within
Jupyter Notebook.

	- Remove Titles where primaryTitle is not the same as originalTitle in
	  order to filter out films which were US Releases of Foreign Films.
	- In order to guarantee title uniqueness for remakes, search for
	  duplicate primaryTitle and concatenate Film Release Year to the
	  primaryTitle.
